# The-Blocks
The Blocks is my hyper-casual game built using Unity Game Engine.

Int this game You control a diagonal-moving block. Your mission is to stop it exactly on top of the previous block. This is done by tapping in absolutely any spot of the screen. There’s almost no delay between your tap and the block stopping, so you have to time it right.

If you do it, then you’re awesome and will get another block exactly the same size. If you fail to do it, the part that is left outside of the underlying block will be chopped off and disappear, and the next block you get will be smaller.

If you keep failing to stop the block exactly on top of the previous one, your block will get smaller and smaller, making the game progressively harder. Also, the movement of each piece will get faster with each block you land successfully, even if it wasn’t spot on.

Each time you lose a piece of your block you start to feel more tense since you see the end of the game on the horizon. There’s always a way of salvaging your session though. If you chain 5 of perfect landings in a row, your block will get a bit bigger. This way you can rectify errors from the past.

Since the game is extremely responsive, you feel absolutely in charge of your victory or demise. Even though this is good, this also means that a small mistake can crush your hopes of surpassing your high score.

The Blocks focuses on relaxation rather than replay value or story and provides an endless game with very simple mechanics, but that can get quite addicting.

PS : its an attempt to clone the stack. :)

So, Download this Exciting Game and get ready to become Addictive :)
